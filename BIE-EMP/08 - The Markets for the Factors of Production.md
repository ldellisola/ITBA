# The Markets for the Factors of Production

The **Factors of Production** are the inputs used to produce goods and services. Between this we have labor, capital and land. The prices and quantities of these inputs are determined by supply and demand in factor markets.

The **Market** for the factors of production is similar to the market of good and services, but here the demand for a factor is production is derived from a firm's decision to supply a good in another market. This is called **derived demand**.

In the following section, we'll be working with the following assumptions:

- All markets are competitive
- Firms care only about maximizing profit.

## The Marginal Product of Labor (MPL)

The Marginal Product of Labor is the increase in the amount of output from an additional unit of labor. It is calculated as:
$$
\text{MPL} = \frac{\Delta Q} {\Delta\text{L}}
$$
The benefit of hiring another worker is usually measured in units of output but the cost of hiring him is measured in dollars, so we need to find a way to convert the MPL to dollars.

We can calculate this as the **Value of the marginal product**. In this case we we'll calculate the value of the marginal product of labor:
$$
\text{VMPL} = P \times \text{MPL}
$$
Where $P$ is the price per unit of output.

### Labor Demand

Because firms want to maximize profit, they will hire workers up to the point where the wages of each worker is the same as the value of the marginal product.

The labor demand curve is the same as the VMPL curve, so any changes to the price of the marginal product will move the curve up and down.

### Input Demand and Output Supply

In general, we can say that the marginal costs is directly related to the wages and the marginal product of labor. They are related by the following equation:
$$
\text{MC} = \frac{\text{W}}{\text{MPL}}
$$
Because of this equation, we can say that the diminishing marginal product and the increasing marginal cost are the same effect.

In a similar fashion, the input demand and output supply behave the same.

### Labor Supply

There's always a trade off between work and leisure because the more time you spend working, the less time you have for leisure. The opportunity cost of leisure is the wage.

In the **Labor Supply Curve**, an increase in wages is an increase in the opportunity cost of leisure, and people will answer by spending more time working. A couple of things can affect this curve, for example changes in tastes or attitudes towards the labor-leisure trade-off, opportunities for workers in other labor markets and immigration.

We will reach an **equilibrium** in the labor market when the wages adjust to balance supply and demand for labor. The wage will always be equal as the VMPL

## Other Factors of Production

### Land and Capital

With land and capital, we must distinguish between:

- **Purchase Price**: The price a person pays to own the factory indefinitely.
- **Rental Price**: The price a person pays to use the factory for a limited period of time.

We can say that the worker's wage is actually the rental price of labor.

Firms decide how much <u>land</u> to rent by comparing the price with the value of the marginal product (VMP) of land. The rental prices will adjust to balance supply and demand. The same applies to <u>capital</u>, but the comparison is done with the marginal product of capital.
