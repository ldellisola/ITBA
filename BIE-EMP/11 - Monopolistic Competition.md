# Monopolistic Competition

After talking about perfect competition and monopolies, we find looking at models of imperfect competition. In this lecture we'll look into monopolistic competition.

This type of competition is characterized for its many sellers, product differentiation and players can enter and exit the market without any costs.

<u>In the sort run</u>, a monopolistic competitive firm warns profit. The quantity is calculated in the same way as in the monopoly, at the point where $MR = MC$ and the profit is calculated using the demand curve.

If the $ATC$ curve is higher than the demand curve the firm can register losses in the short term.

The firms in monopolistic competition behave very similar to a monopoly in the short run, but in the long run the facility to enter and exit a market drives the economic profit to zero.

Monopolistic competition is less efficient than perfect competition for 2 reasons:

- **Excess Capacity**: The monopolistic competitor operates on the downward sloping part of the $ATC$ curve, producing less than the cost-minimizing output.
- **Markup over Marginal Cost**: In a monopolistic competition, the price is higher than the marginal cost.

### Welfare

Monopolistically competitive markets do not have all the desirable welfare properties of perfeclty competitive markets, because there exists a markup, the market quantity is below the  socially efficient quantity.

Also, the number of firms in the market may not be optimal due to external effects from the entry of new firms:

- **The product-variety externality**: The surplus consumers get from the introduction of new products.
- **The Business-stealing externality**: Because entering the market is free, it causes losses on already existing firms.

### Advertising and Brand Recognition

In monopolistic markets product differentiation and markup pricing leads to the use of advertising. In general the more different the products are, the more advertising a firm buys. Critics of advertising claim that society is wasting the resources it devotes to advertising, firms advertise to manipulate people's tastes and it impedes competition.

When it comes to people defending advertisements, their main point is that they inform buyers, promote competition and reduces market power. A firm's willingness to spend a lot of money in advertisements may signal the quality of their products regardless the content of the advert. The reasoning behind this is that ads can only be effective to attract customers one time, and then the quality of the product has to convert them into regular customers.

In many markets, brand name products compete with generic ones. These firms usually spend more money into advertisement and charge more for their products. This can be explained because customers already recognize the quality of a product because of the brand, and the firms have an incentive to maintain the quality of their products so as to don't taint the brand with a bad reputation.

Here we can also find economist that are against brand names as they think it causes consumers to perceive differences that do not really exist. They also consider that willingness to pay more money for brand names is irrational, fueled by advertisement. Elimination government protection of trade marks should incur in lower prices, according to this economists.
