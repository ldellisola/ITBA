# Oligopoly

Oligopolies are another case of imperfect competition. In this case we can say that oligopolies are a market structure in which only a few sellers offer similar or identical products. In this case firms have to implement a strategy, because any changes in price or quantity can affect their competitors.

In order to evaluate if a given market is an oligopoly, we use the **concentration ratio**. This ratio represents the percentage of the market's total output supplied by 4 of its largest firms. Oligopolies occur in markets with a very high concentration ratio.

### Collusion and Cartels

We say that firms are in **collusion** there is an agreement among those firms about the quantity produced or the price if the good in question. **Cartels** are a group of firms that are in collusion. In every situation all firms in a cartel will do better if they stick to their deal, but each firm has its own incentives to renegade on the agreement. 

### Equilibrium in an Oligopoly

Oligopolies are exanimated using game theory. Here there exists the concept of **Nash Equilibrium**, which is a situation where economic participants interacting with each other, chooses their best strategy given the strategy of all the other firms.

When firms in a oligopoly choose the production to maximize profit, they end up with a higher production that in a monopoly, but less than in a perfect competition. In a similar way, their prices are higher than in perfect competition but lower than in a monopoly.

Increasing the output has two effects on a firm's profit:

- **Output Effect**: If the price is higher than the marginal cost, increasing the output raises profits.
- **Price Effect**: Raising the output increases the market quantity, which reduces the prices and thus profits on all units sold.

If the output effect is higher than the price effect, the firm will increase production. 

As the number of firms in the market increases, the price effect becomes smaller and the oligopoly starts to look more like a competitive market, as the market quantity approaches the socially efficient quantity.

The noncooperative oligopoly equilibrium is bad for the firms, as it prevents them for achieving monopoly profits, but it's good for society because it brings down the price and the quantity produced is closed to the socially efficient output.

### Public Policy

In oligopolies the production is too low and the prices too high, relative to the social optimum. The role of policymakers is to promote competition and prevent cooperation between firms in an oligopoly. There are three practice of oligopoly firms that are in direct violation of antitrust policies:

- **Resale Price Maintenance**: It occurs when a manufacturer imposes lower limits on the prices retailers can charge. It is often opposed because it appears to reduce competition at the retail level.
- **Predatory Prices**: This practice involves lowering your prices to drive your competitors out of business or prevent new players from entering the market, so that they can charge monopoly prices later.
- **Tying**: It occurs when a manufacturer bundles two products together and sells them for one price. It tries to take advantage of a strong product to sell more weak products, giving the firm more market power.
