# Monopoly

A monopoly is a firm that is the sole seller of a product without close substitutes. The difference here is that  a monopoly firm has **market power**, the ability to influence the market price of the product it sells.

The main cause of monopolies are **barriers to entry**, meaning that other firms can't enter the market. This is usually the case when a firm owns a key resource, the government gives exclusive rights to produce a good or in the case of **natural monopolies**.

A Natural Monopoly happens when a single firm can produce the entire market $Q$ at a lower costs than several other firms can.

## Demand Curves

In a monopoly, the monopolist is the only seller, so it faces the market demand curve. To sell a larger $Q$ the firm must reduce its price, thus the marginal revenue is different than the price.

The marginal revenue works in a different way here. Increasing the $Q$ has to effects on revenue:

- **Output Effect**: Higher output raises revenue.
- **Price Effect**: Lower price reduces revenue.

To sell a larger quantity, the monopolist must reduce the price of all the units it sells. That's why the marginal revenue is lower than the price. The marginal revenue could even be negative if the price effect exceeds the output effect.
