# Monopoly

A monopoly is a firm that is the sole seller of a product without close substitutes. The difference here is that  a monopoly firm has **market power**, the ability to influence the market price of the product it sells.

The main cause of monopolies are **barriers to entry**, meaning that other firms can't enter the market. This is usually the case when a firm owns a key resource, the government gives exclusive rights to produce a good or in the case of **natural monopolies**.

A Natural Monopoly happens when a single firm can produce the entire market $Q$ at a lower costs than several other firms can.

## Demand Curves

In a monopoly, the monopolist is the only seller, so it faces the market demand curve. To sell a larger $Q$ the firm must reduce its price, thus the marginal revenue is different than the price.

The marginal revenue works in a different way here. Increasing the $Q$ has to effects on revenue:

- **Output Effect**: Higher output raises revenue.
- **Price Effect**: Lower price reduces revenue.

To sell a larger quantity, the monopolist must reduce the price of all the units it sells. That's why the marginal revenue is lower than the price. The marginal revenue could even be negative if the price effect exceeds the output effect.

Similar to a competitive firm, a monopolist maximizes profit by producing the adequate quantity s that $MR = MC$. Once the monopolist identifies this quantity, it sets the highest price consumers are willing to pay for that quantity.

$Q$ is the quantity produced so that $MR=MC$ and then you have to find the price $P$ from the demand curve. The profit of a monopolist is calculated as the difference in price and the average total cost ($ATC$) times the quantity produced:
$$
\text{profit} = (P-ATC) \times Q
$$

## Supply Curves

A monopoly does not have a supply curve because it is a *"price-maker"* where $Q$ does not depend on $P$.

## The Welfare Cost of Monopoly

In a monopoly market equilibrium, the price is higher than the marginal costs:
$$
P > MC = MR
$$
So the value to buyers of an additional unit ($P$) exceeds the cost of the resources needed to produce the unit $MC$. In a monopoly, the $Q$ is usually too low.

The monopoly results in a deadweight loss.

## Price Discrimination

Monopolies can use price discrimination to charge some customers more than others for the same good. The characteristic used in price discrimination is willingness to pay (WTP).

If a monopoly doesn't use price discrimination and sets a single value for the product, it will have deadweight loss and also a consumer surplus. 

The monopolist will produce the competitive quantity and then change each customer their WTP. This is called **perfect price discrimination** and the monopolist will capture all the consumer surplus and have no deadweight loss.

In the real world it is impossible to achieve this, but companies can categorize customers based on some observable trait and try to implement a similar system.

## Public Policy Towards Monopolies

Governments can use different policies to stop companies from becoming a monopoly:

- Antitrust laws to increase competition.
- Regulation of the market in which the monopolist is competing.
- Monopolistic companies can be owned by the government.
- Nothing.
