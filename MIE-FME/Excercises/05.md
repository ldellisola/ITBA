The result is:

x <- init(0,1)
y <- x
x <- add(x,7)
y <- add(y,1)
assume fst(x) = snd(y)
@ snd(x) < 10

### A

> Write down a table showing the values of the program variables at the position of the missing loop invariant at all loop iterations for some non-trivial input.

First program, with input `i = 2`

```
i = 3, -3, -2, -1
```

Second Program, with input  `i=7,k=0`:

```
i = 7, 6, 6, 6, 5, 5, 5, 4, 4, 4, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1,
k = 0, 7, 8, 9, 7, 8, 9, 7, 8, 9, 7, 8, 9, 7, 8, 9, 7, 8, 9,
```

### B

> Provide a variant wrt. an arbitrary well-founded relation. Explain informally why your result is a variant (no assertions or formal proofs are necessary).

For the first program I will use the following well-founded relation:
$$
(a,b)\in R \subset \Z\times \Z \\ 
\iff \\
|a| > |b| \lor (|a| = |b| \land a > b)
$$
This relation is well-founded because it is constantly decreasing the absolute value of the number. To equal numbers cannot be part of the relation, and if two numbers with equal absolute value are in the relation, the right value must always be positive and the left one negative.

For example:
$$
(3,-3) \in R \iff |3| > |-3| \lor (|3| = |-3| \land 3 > -3 )
$$
Here the first section of the term fails because $|3| = 3 =|-3|$. The second part holds because $3 > -3$

Another example:
$$
(-3,-2) \in R \iff |-3| > |-2| \lor (|-3| = |-2| \land -3 > -2)
$$
Here the first term is valid, thus the pair is part of the relation.

For the second program I will use the following well-founded relation:
$$
((i,k),(i',k')) \in Q \subset\N^2\times\N^2 \\ \iff\\
i > i' \lor (i = i' \land (k-1) \text{ mod } 3 < (k'-1) \text{ mod } 3)
$$
This relation is well-founded because it will always drive the value of $i$ down to 0:

For example:
$$
((7,0),(6,7)) \in Q \iff 7 > 6 \lor (7 = 6 \land (0-1) \text{ mod } 3 = 2 <0= (1-1) \text{ mod } 3 )
$$
The first part of the term is valid, so the pair is part of the relation.

Another example>
$$
((6,8),(6,9)) \in Q \iff 6 > 6 \lor (6=6\land (8-1) \text{ mod } 3 = 1 < 2 = (9-1) \text{ mod } 3)
$$

### A

> Add logical formulas as assertions to the program lines starting with @, trying to ensure that all verification conditions hold. It is not important that your answer is correct. But you must be able to:

```pseudocode
found <- False
// Se para en una posicion entre 0 y el final de la palabra menos el finial del subst
for i <- 0 to n-k do:
	// found = true if I already found a substring
	@ i <= n-k AND [found  = Exists t in {0,...,i-1}. substr(a,n,s,k,t)]
	p <- True
	// DEsde donde estoy parado,voy a chequear que el str chico este en los proximos
	// k elementos
	for j <- 0 to k-1 do:
		@ j <= k-1 AND (p = For all t in {0,...,j-1}. a[t + i] = s[t]) AND [found  = Exists t in {0,...,i-1}. substr(a,n,s,k,t)]
		// Si algun elemento no es del str chico, entonces es falso
		if a[i+j] != s[j] then:
			p <- False
		@ (p = For all t in {0,...,j}. a[t + i] = s[t]) AND AND [found  = Exists t in {0,...,i-1}. substr(a,n,s,k,t)]
	if p then:
		found <- True
	@ found = Exist t in [0,i]. substr(.)
@ found <=> exists r. substr(a,n,s,k,r)
```

We can also reuse substring instad of forall ...

p = inicio

n = len(a)

a = arreglo frande

s = arreglo chico

k = len(s)
