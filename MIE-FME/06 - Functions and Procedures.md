# Functions and Procedures

## Function Specification

For using a function, it is sufficient to know its interface. The only important information are the parameters needed and the output.

## Procedure Specification

Procedures are functions in which the parameters are passed as reference instead of as copies. This means that the elements passed to a procedure can be modified inside the function and the value is affected for the rest of the program.
