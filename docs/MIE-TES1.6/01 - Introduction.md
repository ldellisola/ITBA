# Introduction

## Complex technical systems

Are built by big groups of people from different backgrounds and with different objectives.

technical systems should be **safe**. and they interact between physical and electronic components.

They are **reactive** and **concurrent**.

### Design

1. Divide the systems into components. 

   Some components may be too complex and should be divided

2. Assign teams to each component.

### Model

A model abstracts a system by representing it. It hides parts of the design and the unnecessary complexity. The model only describes the aspects that are important for the task at hand.

Types of models:

- **Informal**: It uses natural language and it gives you a rough idea of how it works
- **Mathematical**: Only some people can read them, but It is more precise that informal models.
- **Formal Syntax and semantics**: You now exactly how this model works and what it describes.

Models that take time into account are called **dynamic**. the others are called **static**.
