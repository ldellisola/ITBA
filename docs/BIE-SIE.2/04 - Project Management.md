# Project Management

Project management has many definitions, but according to "best practices" it requires:

1. Planning
2. Execution of the current plan
3. Inclusion of changes into the plan and the project
4. Achieving of objectives related to the product, resources and quality
5. Coordinating the efforts of groups and individuals.
6. Quality assurance and execution.

It also has strong relations to:

- Software Requirements Management.
- Software Architectures.
- Software Configuration Management
- Software Quality Assurance.

and more. It can b summarized as:
$$
\text{"The more you know about what you manage}\\ \text{the better you can manage"}
$$
In general the project manager must create and maintain a plan with a view to sufficiently distant future. The project must be clear with the important dates and the commitments. Also, the team must be informed about their tasks for the current week so they can organize themselves.

The project manager must take care of the efficiency of the ream and understand the system (and its complexity) to discuss them with the client.
