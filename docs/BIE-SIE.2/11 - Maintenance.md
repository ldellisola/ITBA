# Maintenance

By this point we already have the system in production, but we are still working on fixing bugs and relasing them in regular releases. There are different types of maintenance:

- **Corrective**: looks to repair newly found bugs and errors
- **Adaptive**: adapts an application in a changing environment
- **Perfective**: tries to improve performance of maintainability
- **Preventive**: it tries to detect and repair possible errors before they become a reality.

Good documentation is a necessity when maintaining a system.
