# Testing

It is part of the examination of the software operation. It makes sure that the software does what it should do. Its objectives are to help to clearly describe the behavior of the system and find defects in the requirements, design, documentation or code.

The **testing plan** defines the strategy of testing and it always includes the test coverage. It is a combination of test methods and tools. A **test case** is a set of conditions under which the tester will determine whether an application or system is working correctly or not. the **test oracle** is a mechanism for determining whether the software passed or not the certain tests.

The **test script** is a set of instructions that will be performed on a test system to be determined whether the system is working as expected. the **test data** is the specifically identified data for use within a test case, and the **test result** is the result of one or more tests.

It is impossible to do a complete test of the system, but measurements and monitoring the coverage of the tests are important.

Tests differ in many ways. We can classify them based on the type of component we test:

- Unit Test
- Integration Test
- Systems Test
- Acceptation Test

We can also doing on the aspect of the component we test:

- Functional Tests
- Performance Tests
- Security Tests

And finally on the goal of testing:

- Regression Tests
- Qualification Tests

**Black-box** testing is not interested in implementation and are very robust. **White-box** depend on implementation details and they usually break while refactoring.

**Positive testing** means to test what should work, and **negative testing** what shouldn't work.
