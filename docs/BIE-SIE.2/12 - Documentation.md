# Documentation

**Process documentation** describes the process of development and the process of maintenance of a software product. It contains schedules, reports and working papers (key communication channel between developers and leadership).

**Product documentation** describes the software product. It involves user documentation on how to use it, the functional description and a reference manual. There is also a system documentation that specifies the requirements, architecture and design specification and the maintenance docs.

It is a representation of the system, and it should be consistent and up to date.
