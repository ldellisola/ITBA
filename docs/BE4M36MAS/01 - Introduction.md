# Introduction

Multiagent systems is a collection of multiple autonomous agents, each acting towards its objectives while all interactive in a shared environment, being able to communicate and possibly coordinate their actions.

## Agents

### Key properties of Intelligent 

**Autonomy**: Agent is fully accountable for its given state. Agents can see information from the environment and receive information, but their decision is completely their own responsibility.

**Reactivity**: Agents are capable of near-real-time decisions with respect to changes in the environment or new information from other agents.

**Intentionality**: The agent must maintain a long term intention. 

**Rationality**: Is capable of intelligent rational decision making. It can analyze future courses of actions and maximize his goal.

**Social capabilities**:  We cannot go around attempting to achieve goals without taking others into account. Social ability in agents is the ability to interact with other agents via <u>cooperation</u>, <u>coordination</u> and <u>negotiation</u>.

The agent is aware of either:

- Existence
- Communication protocols
- Capability, services provided by other agents.

### Other properties

- **Learning**: learn to adapt to the environment, and to behavior of itself and other agents to increase effectiveness
- **Mobility**: The ability of the agents to move freely between the physical hosts.
- **Rationality**: Whether an agent will act in order to achieve its goals, and will not deliberately act to as to prevent its goals being achieved.
- **Veracity**: Whether the agent will knowingly communicate false information.
- **Benevolence**: Whether agents have conflicting goals, and thus whether they are inherently helpful.

### Agents vs Objects

Agents are programs, and are built out of objects. While object often consist of objects, and object make together an object, agents never contain other agents. Agents build together a multiagent system.

## Multiagent Design Problem

The traditional problem is: *How can I build a system that produces the correct output given some input?*

This question is always answered as isolated systems that are build from scratch

The multi agent problem centers around building an ecosystem of agents that should be robust to changes in its goals.

### Micro vs Macro

It's important to determine the difference between micro and macro design in multiagent systems. **Micro** design is focused on the agent design problem, <u>How should agents act to carry out their tasks?</u>

On the other side, the **macro** design tries to answer the society design problem: <u>How agents interact to carry out their tasks?</u>

### Types of agents systems

#### Single agent

It lives alone and doesn't interact with other agents but its capable of working on its own. ie. Mars robot

#### Cooperative

They work towards a single shared utility. They do not compete to each other.

#### Competitive

They have different utilities and they compete to each other.

### Deployment Opportunities

It has been use as a **design pattern** (Agent oriented programming) that  focuses on creating distributed applications.

**Source of technologies**: Algorithms, models, techniques, architectures, protocols and software packages that facilitate development of multiagent systems.

**Simulation concept**: They use this system to simulate complex and non trivial environments that cannot be simulated mathematically. It focuses on capturing interaction related properties of such systems. i.e. simulation of covid expansion.

It can also be used to make cheaper research with robots, by having a few real robots and simulation the rest as agents.
