# Environment

It can be **fully observable**, when the agent has a complete representation of the environment. When the agent has only partial knowledge of the environment is called **partially observable**.

It can be **deterministic**, where one action has a guaranteed effect, meanwhile **non deterministic** environments are based on statistics.

**Static environments** can only change by the actions of the agents, while **dynamic environments** changes without the control of the agents.

It is **discrete** if there are finite fixed number of actions, while environments can also be **continuous**.

In an **Episodic environment**, the performance of an agent is dependent on a number of discrete episodes, with no link between the performance of an agent in different scenarios. When the current decisions of an agent will affect the future decision of said agent, the environment they are in is called **non-episodic**.

A **Real Time environment** is one in which time plays a part in evaluating an agent's performance.
