# The Market Forces of Supply and Demand

A *market* is a group of buyers and sellers of a particular product. We say that a *competitive market* is one with many buyers and sellers, but each has a neglectable effect on price. Lastly, in a *perfectly competitive market*, all goods are exactly the same and the buyers and sellers are so numerous that no one can afefct the market price.

## Demand

The *quantity demanded* of any good is the amount of the good that buyers are willing and able to purchase. The quantity demanded in the market is the sum of the quantities demanded by all buyers at each price.

The *Law of demand* claims that the quantity demanded of a good falls when the price of the good rises, other things equal.

A *demand schedule* is a table that shows the relationship between the price of a good and the quantity demanded.

### Demand Curve Shifters

The demand curve shows how price affects quantity demanded. The following can affect this curve:

- **Number of Buyers**: When the number of buyers increase, it shifts the curve to the right.
- **Income**: Demand for a *normal good* is positively related to income (if income increases, the curve will shift to the right). Demand for a *negative good* is negatively related to income.
- **Prices of Related Goods**: If two goods are *substitutes*, then an increase in the price of one will cause an increase in the demand of the other. On the other side, two goods are *complements* if an increase in the price of one causes a decrease in demand of the other one.
- **Tastes**: Anything that causes a shift in tastes towards a good will increase the demand for that good.
- **Expectations**: Expectations affect customer's buying decisions.
