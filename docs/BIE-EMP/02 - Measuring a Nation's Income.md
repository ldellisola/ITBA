# Measuring a Nation's Income

In this lecture we'll be discussing macroeconomics.

## Income and Expenditure

**GDP** stands for *Gross Domestic Product*, and it measures the total income of everyone in the economy and the expenditure of the economy's output.

A way to illustrate GDP is with a circular-flow diagram:

Where the *factors of production* are inputs like labor, land, capital and natural resources. *Factor Payments* are payments to the factors of productions, such as wages or rent.

*Households* own the factors of production and sell/rent them to firms for income, while *firms* buy/rent the factors of production in order to produce goods and services, which they sell.

The *markets for goods and services* are confirmed by regular sales of products, such as cellphones or laptops. On the other side, the *markets for factors of production* is where firms can acquire labor or land to produce the goods, for example the job market.

## GDP

The GDP is the market value of all final goods and services within a country in a given period of time. This definition stablished that:

- All goods are evaluated at their market price and only items with an actual market price count.
- Only goods intended for the end user can be counted, for example components in the creation of other goods don't count.
- Both tangible good and intangible services are counted.
- It includes the currently produced goods, not the ones produced in the past. This means that it will count towards the GDP even if the goods are stuck in an inventory.
- It doesn't matter if the goods are produced by citizens or foreigners, as long as they are produced inside the country.

### The components

$$
Y = C+I+H+NX
$$

GDP (denoted as $Y$) is composed by 4 components:

- **Consumption $(C)$**: It is the total spending by household in goods and services. In the case of homeowners, the purchase price or mortage payments are not included in this section.
- **Investment $(I)$**: It is the total spending on goods that will be used in the future to produce more goods. It includes spending on tools, structures and inventories.
- **Government Purchases $(G)$**: Is all the spending on goods and services purchased by the government at all levels. It <u>excludes</u> transfer payments such as social security benefits.
- **Net Exports $(NE)$**: It's the result of all the goods exported minus the goods imported.

### Real and Nominal GDP

Inflation can distort economic variables such as GDP, so we have to versions to solve this problem:

- **Nominal GDP**: It uses the current prices, without taking into consideration the current inflation.
- **Real GDP**: It is calculated taking into consideration inflation and it has to be calculated using a base year.

### GDP Deflator

The GDP deflator is a measure of the overall level of prices. It is an easy way to measure the country's inflation rate. It is calculated as:
$$
\text{GDP Deflator}= 100 \times \frac{\text{nominal GDP}}{\text{real GDP}}
$$

### GDP and Economic Well-Being

Real GDP per capita is the main indicator of the average person's standard of living. GDP does not value the quality of the environment, leisure time, non-market activities or even an equitable distribution of income.

But having a large GDP enables a country to afford better schools, a cleaner environment, healthcare, etc. This is why most indicators of quality of life are positively correlated with GDP.
