# Financial Statements

## Annual report

The annual report of is the most important report corporations issue to stockholders. It contains two types of information:

1. A verbal section that describes the firm's operating results during the past year and then discusses new developments that will affect future operations.

2. Four basic financial statements:

   - Balance Sheet
   - Income Statement
   - Statement of Cash Flows
   - Statement of Retained Earnings

   This section contains what has happened to the assets, earnings and dividends over the past few years

## Balance Sheet

The balance sheet represents a snapshot of the firm's position at a specific point in time. The balance sheet can be schematically represented as a table with two columns: the left side shows the assets that the company owns while the right side shows the liabilities of the company.

### Assets

Assets are divided into current and **long-term assets** based the time needed to liquidate them. If the assets can be liquidated within one year, they are **current assets**.

### Liabilities 

Liabilities are the money the company owes creditors. Liabilities can also be subdivided into current and **long-term liabilities** based on the time in which they must be paid. **Current liabilities** must be payed within one year.

### Equity

Equity is classified as common stock and retained earnings. **Common stock** is the amount of money the share holders payed the company when it originally issued stock. **Retained Earnings** are the savings of the company.

### Depreciation and Taxes

Most companies prepare two sets of financial statements, one for tax purposes and one for stockholders reporting. The difference between these documents is how the depreciation is accounted for. 

Depreciation works because long-term assets loose their value over time and it allows for companies to pay less taxes. In the balance sheet the assets are values at purchase price minus depreciation

## Income Statement

The income statement summarizes the firm's revenue and expenses for the year. This section shows the net sales of the company and how much each expense or tax is affecting the net income. 

Here we can see a few different intermediate values such as:

- **EBITDA**: It stands for Earnings Before Interest, Taxes and Depreciation. It can be calculated as:
  $$
  \text{EBITDA} = \text{Net Sales} - \text{Operational Costs}
  $$

- **EBIT**: It stands for Earnings Before Interests and taxes:
  $$
  \text{EBIT} = \text{EBITDA} - \text{Depreciation}
  $$

- **EBT**: It stands for Earnings Before Taxes:
  $$
  \text{EBT} = \text{EBIT} - \text{Interest}
  $$

We can finally obtain the **net income** from the $EBT$:
$$
\text{Net Income} = \text{EBT} - \text{Taxes} = \text{EBT} \times (1- \text{Tax Rate})
$$

### Depreciation and Amortization

An important component of the operating costs are amortization and depreciation. These terms are similar, but they deal with different types of assets. **Depreciation** is the change of value of tangible assets while **amortization** deals with intangible assets such as patents or copyrights.

## Cash Flow Statement

There are several key factors that affect a company's cash balance:

- Cash flow
- Changes in working capital
- Fixed assets
- Security transactions and dividend payments

Each of these factors is reflected in the statement of cash flows, which summarizes the changes in a company's cash position.

There are 3 main categories in the cash flow statement:

- **Operating Activities**: It includes net income, depreciation, and changes in working capital other than cash and short-term debt.
- **Investing Activities**: It includes purchases or sales of fixed assets.
- **Financing Activities**: It includes raising cash by issuing debt, stock or using cash to pay dividends or buy back stocks.

### Net Cash Flow

The cash flows of the company determines the stock price and management's goal should be to maximize stock price. It can be calculated as:
$$
\text{Net Cash Flow} = \text{Net Income} + \text{Depreciation} + 
\text{Amortization}
$$
 It represents the cash a business generates in a given year.

### Statement of Retained Earnings

This document reports what share of the profits was reinvested and how much of the firm's earnings were retained in the business rather than paid as dividends.
