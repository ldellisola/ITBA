# Supply, Demand and Government Policies

## Government Policies to alter the Market

The government has a few different method to affect the free market. Those methods can come in the form of **price controls**, such as **price ceilings** or **price floors**. Another method they can use are **taxes**.

### Shortages

Shortages force the sellers to ration the goods among buyers. The mechanism that the sellers use are often unfair and inefficient, so the goods don't always go to the person that values them the most.

## Price Ceilings

Price ceilings are tools used by governments to create a maximum price for a given good. If a price ceiling is set **above the equilibrium** point of the supply demand model, then we say that the price ceiling is **not binding**, because it has not effect on the market. In reality, any kind of price ceiling would affect the market in some way.

If the price ceiling is **set below the equilibrium** point, then the ceiling is a **binding constraint** on the price, and it creates a **shortage**.

## Price Floors

Price floors are tools used by governments to set the minimum price of a given good. 

If the price floor is **below the equilibrium** point, then we say it is **not binding**. In a similar fashion, this means that in theory they don't have any effect on the market but in reality they always have.

When the price floor is **above the equilibrium** point, it becomes a **binding constraint** that causes a **surplus**.

## Taxes

The government levies taxes on many goods and services to raise revenue to pay for national defense, public schools, etc. This tax can be **forced into the seller or the buyer** and its usually a percentage of the price or an specific amount per unit.

### Tax on Buyers

A tax on the buyers' side causes a shift down in the demand curve $D$, by the amount of the tax.

Because the demand curve was shifted, we lost our equilibrium point. To fix this issue, both the seller and the buyer will share the tax.
