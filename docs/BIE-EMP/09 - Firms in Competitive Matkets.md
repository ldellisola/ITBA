# Firms in Competitive Markets

Ina market with **perfect competition** we have the following characteristics:

- Many buyers and sellers
- The goods offered are largely the same
- Firms can freely enter or exit the market

Because of the first 2 characteristics, we can say that buyers and sellers are **price takers**, actors too small to affect the price.

We are going to use the following assumptions on the market supply:

-  All existing firms and potential entrants have identical costs.
- Each firm's costs do not change as other firms enter or exit the market.
- The number of firms in the market is fixed in the short-run (due to fixed costs) and variable in the long-run (due to free entry and exit)

### Revenue

There are different metrics to measure the revenue of a competitive firm:

- **Total Revenue (TR)**:
  $$
  \text{TR} = P \times Q
  $$

- **Average Revenue (AR)**:
  $$
  \text{AR} = \frac {\text{TR}} {Q} = P
  $$

- **Marginal Revenue (MR)**: It's the change in TR from selling one more unit.
  $$
  \text{MR} = \frac {\Delta \text{TR}} {\Delta Q}
  $$

- 

In a *competitive market*, competitive firms can keep increasing its output without affecting the market price, so for every one-unit increase in $Q$ causes revenue to rise by $P$. This causes that $\text{MR} = P$.

### Profit

In order to maximize profit, we need to increase our supply until the moment the marginal cost (MC) is higher than the marginal revenue (MR).

## Shutdown vs Exit

When the market is not favorable for firms, they have two choices:

- The firms can **Shutdown**, which means to stop production for a short period of time until the conditions of the market improve.
- The firms can **Exit** the market, meaning that they plan no to return to the market in the future, even if the condition improve.

The main difference between this two actions is that if the firm shuts down in the short run, they have to still pay for the fixed cost. In the case of an exit, the firms have no costs in the long run.

The cost of shutting down for a firm is in the lost revenue, but they also benefit because they don't have to pay for variable costs. So the firm should shut down if the total revenue is less than the variable costs. In other words, the firms has to shut down if:
$$
P \lt \text{AVG}
$$
The **sunken cost** is a cost that has already been committed and cannot be recovered. This types of costs should be irrelevant to your decision whether to shutdown or exit the market, as that's money you already spent. This is why fixed costs don't matter in the previous equation.

In the case of exiting the market, the firm will loss money on the total revenue but they will save the total cots of operating (fixed cost is zero in the long run), so the firm should exit the market if their total revenue is less than the total cost. This could be rewritten as:
$$
P \lt \text{ATC}
$$
A new firm will **enter the market** if it is profitable to do so, this means that the total revenue must be higher than the total cost. This means that:
$$
P > \text{ATC}
$$

### Entry and Exit in the Long Run

In the long run, the number of firms can change due to entry and exit. If existing firms earn positive economic profit, then new firms will enter the market, increasing the supply and causing the price to lower, reducing profits and slowing the entry. If on the other hand, the existing firms are not profitable, the Short run supply curve will shift left, increasing the price and reducing the losses.

### The Zero-Profit Condition

Zero economic profit occurs when the price equals the average total cost. Because we know that firms will produce until the marginal revenue is the same as the marginal cost (and the same as the price), we can say that the zero-profit condition when the price equals the average total cost.

Because of this, we can say that the price, in the long run, will be the minimum average total cost of the market. This means that in the long run, the firms will have zero profit.

### The Long Run Supply Curve

The Long Run supply curve may be horizontal if:

- All firms have identical costs.
- Costs do not change as other firms enter of leave the market.

If either of these assumptions is not true, the the supply curve will slope upward.

As price raises, firm with lower costs will enter the market before firms with higher costs. If the price keeps increasing then it is worthwhile for the firms with higher costs to enter the market and increase market quantity supplied. This causes the Long Run supply curve to slope upwards. At any price, the marginal firm will put the price at its minimum ATC and zero profit, while firms with lower costs will be profitable.

In some industries, the supply of key input is limited, and thus the entry of new firms increases the demand for this input, causing the price to raise for all firms' costs. Hence, an increase in price is required to increase the market quantity supplied, so the supply curve will be upward-slopping.
