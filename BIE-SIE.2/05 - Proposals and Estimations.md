# Proposals

There are different proposal types, varying from creating a completely new system to modifying and existing one, lending a team or bodyshop.

The proposal creation process has to solve at least the following problems:

-  Identification of proposals
- Responsibilities
- Creating of the actual proposal
- Review
- Laboriousness evidence

The **scope** is determined exhaustively and in a structured way, with a positive and negative definition. This will determine the price of the project. It can be modified later but it will have a monetary cost.

## Estimations

The estimations are made using pricing models, precious experience with similar projects and a good history of past projects.

The history of projects should contain the overall effort, calendar time and number of people working on each past project. It can also have the labor intensity and calendar time according to the types of activities and the characteristics of the systems and agenda. IT should also have the problems we encountered and the risks. 

The estimations of the project rely heavily in the following metrics:

- time
- scope
- effort
- quality

It's easy to get precise numbers for those metrics after the project is done from sources such as Jira and Gitstats.
