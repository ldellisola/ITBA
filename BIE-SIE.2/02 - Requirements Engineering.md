# Requirements Engineering

**Requirements Engineering** is a systems and software engineering process which covers all the activities involved in discovering, documenting and maintaining a set of requirements for a computer-based system. It involves doing <u>elicitation</u> (meetings, documents versioning, observations), <u>analysis</u> (debates, remarks), <u>specification</u> (decomposition, writing, creating a notation) and <u>verification</u> (meeting, testing GUIs, scopes)  several times often in parallel with people from all parts of the project.

This discipline was created because poorly defined requirements cause the failure of project. With a good specification of the requirements, we can create a better **scope** (a contract on what you will deliver in the final product). It also serves as a basic part of the system's documentation and it can help determine the correct price of the work.

### Basic Terms

The **Project Scope** is the work that needs to be accomplished to deliver a product, service or result with the specified features and functions. This includes all your commitments, features and expectations of the project.

There are several different kinds of requirements :

- **Functional Requirements**: These are the basic functions that the project must be able to accomplish. 
- **Interfaces Requirements**: It involves UI design and communication between different systems.
- **Non-functional Requirements**: These requirements are not related with the functionality of the system, but with the performance, security, reliability and scalability of it.
- **Internalization Requirements**: Here there are a variety of requirements, from legislative to support of different languages and regions.
- **Accessibility Requirements**: They decide how and if the system should allow people with different accessibility (blind, deaf) capabilities are going to interact with it.

According to the IEEE, all requirements must comply with the following requirements:

- They must be **correct**, meaning that they should correctly describe the system behavior and it should be doable.
- They have to be **unambiguous**. They should only have one interpretation.
- The software requirements documents should completely describe the system's behavior, meaning they have to be **complete**.
- The requirements must be **consistent** and not contradict each other.
- Software requirements should be **ranked** based on their importance.
- They must be **verifiable**, so the developers can check when a requirement is met.
- In the everchanging world of software development, the requirements should be easily **modifiable**.
- Because the requirements have to be modifiable, they also have to be **traceable**, to know why and when the changes occurred.

### Business vs Requirements Analysis

Both business and requirement analysis have a large overlap, and they often get mixed up. The main difference lays in that business analysis focuses on identifying changes necessary for achieving the strategic objectives of the organization. This changes span different sectors such as:

- Strategy
- Organization structure
- Politics
- Processes and data flows
