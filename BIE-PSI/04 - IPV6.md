# IPV6

When creating the new protocol for IP addresses, we had new requirements for it:

- Larger address space
- Automatic configuration without external server (DHCP)
- QoS support
- Extended security
- Mobility (Similar to roaming in telecommunication networks)

## Header

The headers in this new version also changed, for once, the size of the header changed from 32 bits to 64 bits:

There also have been changes to the fields of the headers:

We can go over these fields:

- **Version**: it takes 4 bits of space and it says the number 6.
- **Source & Destination address**: Both fields are 128 bits long and they have a 4 times longer address and allow or 2^96^ times larger address space.
- **Payload Length**: It is a 16 bit field that is calculated from the end of the main header, and it includes extension headers.
- **Next Header**: This 8 bit field says if the next chink is data or another header.
- **Hop Limit**: It takes 8 bits to say the maximum number of hops the package is allowed to take. It functions in a similar way to the TTL field in IPv4, and it helps to protect the network for loops. Each router will reduce the value by one, and once the value is 0, the package is discarded.
- **Traffic Class**: This field splits into 2, a differentiated services section with 6 bits, and an explicit congestion notification that takes 2 bits. 
- **Flow Label**: This 20 bit field was introduced in this revision of the standard, it is used for identification of data flow to make routing easier.

## Extension Headers

Extension headers may be placed after the main IPv6 header and there is only one requirement, the *"Hop-by-Hop"* header has to be the first one. Also, the last header has to contain the type of data in the payload.

## Jumbogram

The maximal payload length is 65535, but IPv6 allows larger packets called jumbograms, up to 4 GB. This makes sense for MTUs (maximum transfer unit) higher than 64 kB. For this the payload length has to be set to 0 and the length value is in the EH type *"Hop-by-Hop"* options.

## Fragmentation

For IPv6, the minimal MTU is 1280 bytes, and fragmentation is performed by the sender, not the routers. If a packet is larger, the router will drop it or send an ICMP message to the sender with MTU information.

## Address Notation

The IPv6 address is split in 8 groups of 4 hex numbers (16 bytes, 128 bits). Each group is separated by the delimiter character `:`, but if there is a continuous group or groups of 0s, they can be substituted by `::`. The last 4 bytes can be written in decimal form, with the delimiter `.` to maintain compatibility with IPv4, but this implementation is not mandatory.

Here we can see examples of the same address:

```
0221:0db8:0000:0000:0000:0000:1428:57ab
0221:0db8:0000:0000:0000::1428:57ab
0221:0db8:0:0:0:0:1428:57ab
0221:0db8::1428:57ab
0221:0db8::20.40.87.171
```

IPv6 addresses can be one of the following types:

- **unicast**: Individual addresses
- **multicast**: The address represents a group of addresses. 
- **anycast**: It is similar to multicast, but the packet will be delivered to only one random host.

IPv6 addresses also have different reserved ranges, for example:

- `::1/128`: Loopback
- `fc00::/7`: Unique Local Address
- `fe80::/10`: Link Local Range
- `ff00::/8`: Multicast
- `2000::/3`: Global addresses
- `2001:db8::/32`: Used for documentation and illustration purposes

### Global IPv6 Address

All global IPv6 addresses have a prefix of `2000::/3` for now. The rest of the structure is defined by a Global routing prefix, SLA and interface ID.

The interface ID can be constructed from the MAC address of the device:

### Addresses of the Network Interface

The network interface has multiple IPv6 addresses:

- Loopback
- Local link
- Unicast and multicast
- multicast for all nodes
- multicast for groups of which it is a member
- Solicited-node multicast (neighbor discovery)

The router has additional addresses:

- Multicast for all routers
- Subnet-router anycast
- All assigned anycast addresses

## Neighbor Discovery Protocol

It is the extended replacement for ARP, and it uses ICMPv6 for:

- Router Solicitation
- Router Advertisement
- Neighbor Solicitation
- Neighbor Advertisement
- Redirect

It allows us to:

- Find out link addresses in the local network
- Quick update of changes and invalid entries
- Routers discovery
- Redirection
- Detection of duplicate addresses
- Verification of Neighbors' accessibility
- Discover information for automatic configuration

## MultiProtocol Label Switching (MPLS)

MPLS is a routing technique that directs data from one node to the next based on short path labels rather than long network addresses. In the OSI model this protocol would fall between the second and third layer, and it adds a label to layer 3 packets. The packets are then switched according to the label. This implements an *end-to-end* connection independent of the link layer.

### MPLS Header

The MPLS header is compose by the label, which takes up 20 bits, the traffic class (3 bits), the bottom of label stack flag (1 bit) and then the Time-to-Live, which takes up 8 bits. The total size of the header is 32 bits.

### MPLS Network

When a packet enters the MPLS network, the Label Edge Router (LER) attaches a label to it. Inside the network, the  packets are forwarded according to the labels by Label Switching Routers (LSRs). When a packet exits the MPLS network, the edge router removes the label.
